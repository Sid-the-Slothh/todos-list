# A "todo" web app
This app will help you create a simple list of tasks, called "todos" (things *to do*). This app uses local storage to store the todos you've created. This app also has the functionality to delete a todo.

Along with todos, there is a "completed section". You can mark a todo as "completed", and either reuse it at a later point (by marking as "uncomplete")

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
